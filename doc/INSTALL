Step 0 

on Mac OS X systems, and perhaps others, optionally put the
following into your ~/.cshrc file.  It will greatly speed up
the build process:

  # for gnu make, etc. to take advantage of multiple CPUs
  setenv NCPUs `sysctl -n hw.ncpu`
  set NJOBS_make = $NCPUs
  @ NJOBS_make++
  setenv MAKEFLAGS "-j $NJOBS_make"

Note: if someone figures out how to do the above for boost/bjam please update this file.

Step 1

Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install libfltk1.3-dev libfltk1.3

download the latest stable fltk-1.3 from http://fltk.org/software.php
  (vp does not build with fltk 2.0, yet)
expand
cd
./configure 
make
sudo make install


Step 2

download flews from http://dbarrero.tripod.com/software/flews-0.3.tar.gz or https://github.com/proyZ/FL_Flews

expand
cd
./configure
edit source code to remove bogus "include <values.h>" if necessary
make  
  don't worry if flews test doesn't link.  it is not necessary for vp.  
  If you want to test flews, edit the flews makefile to have the correct locations

If you used Github version, symlink: ln -s FL_Flews flews-0.3.1

Step 3

Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install libblitz0-dev libblitz0ldbl

download the latest blitz from http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=63961

expand
./configure --disable-shared
make lib
make check-testsuite  (see if all tests pass)
sudo make install  (you can ignore errors pertaining to .pdf files and .tex files)


Step 4

Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install libgsl0-dev

download the lastest gsl from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gsl/

./configure --disable-shared
make
make check  (see if all tests pass)
sudo make install


Step 5.1

Download, build, and install boost, see: http://www.boost.org/users/download/
Since vp uses the boost serialization library, you do have to build boost.  The "header only" libraries are not adequate.
./configure
make  

The above takes a while.  Perhaps someone can insert the instruction
for building only the static, single-threaded, serialization library)

Step 5.2

Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install libccfits-dev

Download, build and install cfitsio from http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/fitsio.html

(we know there are a huge number of data file formats.  But viewpoints
was initially written for astrophysical data analysis, and
astrophysicists use FITS)

./configure
make
sudo make install


Step 6

make sure you have an svn client installed.  Then:
svn -checkout (or -update) latest vp sources from http://svn2.assembla.com/svn/viewpoints
then edit vp/makefile for the appropriate machine/OS/debugging combination & file locations
make

Step 7

test vp, eg. "vp -i sampledata.txt"


Step 8

Do some real work.
